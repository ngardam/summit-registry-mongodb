### Overview

In this workshop you will be building a digital [summit registry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_register) to gain more understanding of CRUD (Create, Read, Update Delete) database functionality with MongoDB. You will also be using Express as a server and React as your front-end framework.

To complete this workshop, begin in `server.js` and follow the scaffolded instructions in the comments. You will also need to work in `Entry.js` for your Schema.

This workshop utilizes the localhost MongoDB database.

### Objective

The outcome will be a fully functional CRUD web application.

### Topics

> - MongoDB
> - Express
> - React

### Context

What is "CRUD"?

It's an acronym that refers to the four basic functions required for a persistence storage application. It is not unique to MongoDB, but refers to a greater mental model that is necessary to implementing persistent data storage.

* Create - insert new entries into the database.
* Read - display the database entries on the page.
* Update - change preexisting entries in the database.
* Delete - remove preexisting entries from the database.

Implementing REST with CRUD would have the urls of each action reflective of what is happening.
